# Project Overview
Using tweet and Bitcoin data we set out to determine if Elon Musk has any impact on the cryptocurrency market. We focused on Bitcoin (BTC) volume and valuations to find the correlation, if any.

# Key Questions
1. Does Elon Musk tweet about the cryptocurrency?

2. Does Elon Musk's tweets have an impact in the cryptocurrency market?

3. Compare historical Bitcoin valuation and volume data to Elon's social media activity

4. Does the public follow Elon for his tweets on cryptocurrency?
